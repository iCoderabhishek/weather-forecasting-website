**Project Title:** Simple Weather Forecast Web App

**Overview**

This project is a basic weather forecasting website designed for a college-level web development course.  Its goal is to demonstrate the following key concepts:

* **API Integration:** Fetching real-time weather data from a third-party API (Accuweather API).
* **Data Handling:** Parsing and processing JSON-formatted weather data.
* **UI Design:** Creating a clean, user-friendly interface to display current weather conditions and forecasts.
* **Responsive Design:** Ensuring the website adapts to different screen sizes.

**Technologies Used**

* **HTML:** Basic page structure
* **CSS:** Styling and layout
* **JavaScript:** API calls, data manipulation, and dynamic content updates.
* **[Name of Weather API]:**  Forecast API

**Getting Started**

1. **Obtain API Key:** Register for a free API key from your chosen weather API provider.
2. **Clone Repository:** Download or clone the project files.
3. **API Key Setup:** Replace the placeholder API key in the JavaScript file with your own.
4. **Local Server:** Open `index.html` in your web browser. (Most browsers work fine, but some might have security restrictions if you aren't using a simple local server like Python's `http.server`)

**Features**

* Displays current weather conditions (temperature, description, humidity, etc.) for a user-specified location.
* Provides a simple forecast.
* User-friendly search functionality for locations.

**Known Limitations**

* Limited forecast range and detail.
* No error handling for invalid locations or API issues.
* Design may be simplistic.

**Potential Enhancements**

* More detailed forecasts (hourly breakdowns, extended outlook).
* Interactive map for location selection.
* Improved UI with icons and animations.
* User settings for temperature units (Celsius/Fahrenheit).

**Educational Value**

This project is a great way to practice core web development skills while interacting with real-world data. It serves as a strong foundation for building more advanced weather applications.
